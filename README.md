# Office management application

You will create an application to organize the office's management.

Everyday in the morning we need an employe to open the office, the conference room, etc.
In the afternoon we need another employe to lockdown the rooms before closing the office.

If an employe isn't available we need to change the weekly plan


# Application features
- A list of all the employee (provided)
- An overview of available/unavailable employee

- If an employee becomes unavailable the weekly plan will update accordingly
